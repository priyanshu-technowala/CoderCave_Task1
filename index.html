          <p>Tata Consumer shares in news as Tata group firm denies talks with Haldiram's</p>
          <img src="img.avif">
          <p>Shares of Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL) will be in focus on Thursday morning after the Tata group firm said it was not negotiating with Haldiram's, as suggested by a Reuters report a day ago. TCPL shares had climbed 4 per cent in the previous session after Reuters suggested the Tata groupâ€™s consumer unit was in talks to buy at least 51 per cent of popular Indian snack food maker but is not comfortable with the $10 billion valuation sought.

            "The company is not in negotiations as reported in the above-referred news article," TCPL said post market hours of Wednesday. Tata Consumer added that it is not aware of any information that has not been announced to the stock exchanges, which requires disclosures under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.</p>
